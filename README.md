A simple SQL sandbox playground web app to practice SQL queries on sample data from a database.

**Notes**:
- The "database" in question is a connection to an SQLite3 file with attached datbases to simulate multiple schemas. No SQL server of any kind was used because it was not necessary.
- Database data was mainly taken from this [YouTube Tutorial](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA>) about MySQL, with slight modifications to suit the nature of the questions in the web app.
- More questions can be added to the question bank. Submit a pull request to add questions. Questions must be based on the sample data in the database, which you can view at the link to the app below.
- Certain commands that work in other SQL platforms or editors **may not** work in this application.
